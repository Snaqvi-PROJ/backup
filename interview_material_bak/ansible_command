1. Ansible is simple open source IT engine which automates application deployment,
intra service orchestration, cloud provisioning and many other IT tools.

2. Ansible is agentless,

3. Ansible connect to the nodes and then pushes small programs called "ansible modules".
Ansible runs anible modules on nodes and then removes them

4. inventory are host files in which hosts are grouped and ansible can control the actions on specific group in playbook

5. Control machine: machine from where we could manage other machines.
   Remote machine: machines which are handled/controled by control machine.

6. In playbooks, data is represented in yaml format 'key:value'

7. Adhoc commands are commands which could be run individually to perform quick functions,
   These are 1 time usage commands

Example:
  ansible -i hosts all -m ping  # Ping all the hosts from all group present in hosts inventory file
  ansible -i hosts all -m ping --limit host2  # Same command, but will run on a specific host.
  ansible abc -a "/sbin/reboot" -f 12  # To reboot all the company servers in 12 parallel forks
  ansible abc -m yum -a "name = demo-tomcat-1 state = present"  # Checks if a yum package is installed or not
  ansible abc -m copy -a "src = /etc/yum.conf dest = /tmp/yum.conf" # copy a file to servers in group abc
